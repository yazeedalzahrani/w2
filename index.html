    <h1>Have you ever made a pizza from scratch?</h1>
    <h2>Yeah but have you really thought about it? </h2>
    <h3>Like , how if you put the sauce on first , before you make the base it does not work? </h3>
    <h4> or , if you put the cheese on then the sauce it is messed up too <h4>
<!-- add some copy here -->
<p class="special">
    Making a pizza is similar to coding. There are
    certain things we have to do first. Like making the
    base, letting it rise, mould the base out, add the
    sauce, add the toppings, add the cheese, bake, and cut
    and serve. Not all pizzas end up the same, but they do
    start out in the same way as long as you follow the
    order correctly. You can have everything you need to
    make many different pizzas using the same base
    structure that is set up before hand.
